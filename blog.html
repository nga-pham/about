    <h2>Why I Started Learning Web Development</h2>
    <p><em>Posted on October 13, 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      I’ve always been fascinated by how websites work. After spending years in
      a different field, I decided to dive into coding and start learning HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to become a full-stack web developer and create tools that help
      people learn faster and work smarter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this journey, I’ve learned that consistency is more important than
      talent. Every small step adds up — and that’s what I want to share in this blog.
    </p>
