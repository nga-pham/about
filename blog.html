    <h2>AI is now an evolution. What's next?</h2>
    <p><em>Posted on October 13, 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      When I was in Europe, in 2017, students have already talked about AI and its rapid progress. In 2022, the technology world was shaken by the first AI agent - chatGPT. In around 2024 and 2025, it was Vietnamese people's turn to talk about it, but at this time, AI agents had become popular and Vietnam was only able to get benefit from the top of the mountain - the application layer.

    <p>
      In 2019, my colleagues talked about quantum computing and predicted it would be the future. Why? As the application layer of computer science evolves (software, AI agents), hardware will have to speed up to meet the needs of software development. For example, AI agents cannot improve without high-power GPUs to increase training speed. And quantum computing is currently the optimal solution to overcome limitations of current processing speed. Maybe that's why this year's Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to quantum mechanics.

      So I think, whoever has money should invest in companies about core technology like quantum computing. If I were in Vietnam and rich, I would buy stocks from VRDC, the AI center partnered with NVIDIA . Things like AI or virtual currency are just the tip of the iceberg. If you invest in them, you can only surf the waves and will not be as stable as core technology.
